## Goals
This starter repo is intended to provide a quick-start scenario for building MVPs that that can be quickly deployed to Supabase and the related ecosystem.

Minimal UI styling, with simple straightforward usage of Nuxt UI Labs component library and basic tailwind tweaks.  It should be relatively painless to swap in a different library for this purpose.

A modular approach to database design meant to be scalable in the short term, and ready for refactoring should major services need to be split off in the future.

Multi-tenancy support that includes the ability for individuals to work in many contexts, with varying permission levels depending on tenant residency.
